    "First, we must define a function that represents the Maxwellian distribution for sampling. When performing rejection sampling, it is often useful to plot the distribution over a wide variety of energies to determine a good range to sample in. Looking at the first plot below, it is clear why the energy range chosen was $E = [0.0,1 \\times 10^6]$. In addition, the maximum height chosen was determined by the max of the function in the range chosen. It is acceptable to chose a wider range, but it will require a larger number of samples for the same result. Bounding the samples to a reasonable range is a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\br$We will then loop through each number of samples requested. Empty lists are created that will be filled with the rejected and accepted samples. Another loop is then created that will loop through the desired number of samples. A $v$ is then sampled in the range above from a uniform distribution, and the same done in the $y$ direction. Each sample is checked and either accepted or rejected.\n",
